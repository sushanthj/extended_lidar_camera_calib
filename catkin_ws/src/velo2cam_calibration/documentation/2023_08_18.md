# Velo2Cam August 18 Trials

- The calibration board (0.5x scale) was used along with Aruco tags to attempt calibration
- The ordering of the target seems to be different in the repo but it did not affect the detections

## Lidar Detections

The target geometry for the Lidar are determined by the circular holes and the Lidar
points which fall on the surface behind the target. The original cloud is huge and
will need to be filtered

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/raw_cloud.png)

The filtering of the above cloud is done in two steps:

### Range Filtered Cloud

This pointcloud will need to be filtered using the **max and min passthrough radius** to
remove all points except the target board as shown below

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/range_filtered_cloud.png)

### zyx Filtered Cloud

The passthrough_x_velo, passthrough_y_velo, and passthrough_z_velo needs to be set to filter
the cloud to make only the target and the scan lines passing through the target circles

## Issues with Lidar Detections

Although the filtering seems to work and 4 centers are found, it cannot still find the
target geometry. The error is shown below:

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/lidar_calib_issue.png)

I looked up the calculations which determine if a good enough match has been found
for the detected circles

```cpp
/**
    Geometric consistency check
    At this point, circles' center candidates have been computed
  (found_centers). Now we need to select the set of 4 candidates that best fit
  the calibration target geometry. To that end, the following steps are
  followed: 1) Create a cloud with 4 points representing the exact geometry of
  the calibration target 2) For each possible set of 4 points: compute
  similarity score 3) Rotate back the candidates with the highest score to their
  original position in the cloud, and add them to cumulative cloud

  std::vector<std::vector<int>> groups;
  comb(centroid_candidates->size(), TARGET_NUM_CIRCLES, groups);
  double groups_scores[groups.size()];  // -1: invalid; 0-1 normalized score
  for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); ++i) {
    std::vector<pcl::PointXYZ> candidates;
    // Build candidates set
    for (int j = 0; j < groups[i].size(); ++j) {
      pcl::PointXYZ center;
      center.x = centroid_candidates->at(groups[i][j]).x;
      center.y = centroid_candidates->at(groups[i][j]).y;
      center.z = centroid_candidates->at(groups[i][j]).z;
      std::cout << "For Group " << j << std::endl;

      candidates.push_back(center);
    }

    // Compute candidates score
    Square square_candidate(candidates, delta_width_circles_,

    groups_scores[i] = square_candidate.is_valid()

  }

  int best_candidate_idx = -1;
  double best_candidate_score = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); ++i) {
    if (best_candidate_score == 1 && groups_scores[i] == 1) {
      // Exit 4: Several candidates fit target's geometry
      ROS_ERROR(

      return;
    }
    if (groups_scores[i] > best_candidate_score) {
      best_candidate_score = groups_scores[i];
      best_candidate_idx = i;
    }
  }

  if (best_candidate_idx == -1) {
    // Exit 5: No candidates fit target's geometry
    ROS_WARN(
        "[LiDAR] Unable to find a candidate set that matches target's "
        "geometry");
    return;
  }
```

```cpp
bool is_valid() {
    pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr candidates_cloud(
        new pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>());
    // Check if candidates are at 5% of target's diagonal/2 to their centroid
    for (int i = 0; i < _candidates.size(); ++i) {
      candidates_cloud->push_back(_candidates[i]);
      float d = distance(_center, _candidates[i]);
      // NOTE: target_diagonal is calculated as: _target_diagonal = sqrt(pow(width, 2) + pow(height, 2));
      if (fabs(d - _target_diagonal / 2.) / (_target_diagonal / 2.) >
          GEOMETRY_TOLERANCE) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    // Check perimeter?
    std::vector<pcl::PointXYZ> sorted_centers;
    sortPatternCenters(candidates_cloud, sorted_centers);
    float perimeter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < sorted_centers.size(); ++i) {
      float current_distance = distance(
          sorted_centers[i], sorted_centers[(i + 1) % sorted_centers.size()]);
      if (i % 2) {
        if (fabs(current_distance - _target_height) / _target_height >
            GEOMETRY_TOLERANCE) {
          return false;
        }
      } else {
        if (fabs(current_distance - _target_width) / _target_width >
            GEOMETRY_TOLERANCE) {
          return false;
        }
      }
      perimeter += current_distance;
    }
    float ideal_perimeter = (2 * _target_width + 2 * _target_height);
    if (fabs((perimeter - ideal_perimeter) / ideal_perimeter >
             GEOMETRY_TOLERANCE)) {
      return false;
    }

    // Check width + height?
    return true;
  }
```

Looking at the above code, I decided to try two things:
1. Increase the GEOMETRY_TOLERANCE value
2. Remove the perimeter check just to try

Increasing the Geometry tolerance from 0.06 to 0.1 did help and it accumulates valid clusters
over many frames now (not very consistent though). Futher, this incosistency
causes the calibration to get stuck post the warm-up phase

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/geometry_tol_0.1.png)

Removing the Perimeter check and increasing Geometry Tolerance to 0.5 did seem to help
as seen below

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/geometry_tol_0.5_no_perimeter.png)

The calibration node does not exit on it's own and user needs to wait till sensor1 pattern
and sensor2 pattern are done as shown below

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/calib_ready.png)

The **final output is stored as a launch file which publishes a static transform** between
Lidar and Camera. The output from the above testing is seen below. From manual approximation
of the extrinsics, the results look clearly wrong.

![](/velo2cam_calibration/documentation/images/bad_calib_result.png)


## Trial with Enabled Perimeter Check and Looser Geometric Tolerance

I set the Geometry Tolerance to 0.3 (30cm) which is probably too huge. This resulted
in the node working, but the transformation to be same as above.

The angles translated to Euler angles (degrees): ```[-89.99999999971946, -0.0, -89.99999999971946]```

# Inference From Above Tests

1. I'm yet to verify why the translational component is always zero
2. The Aruco tags are sensitive and the camera needs to be very close to detect them accurately
3. I'm not sure if the node exited correctly (since I had to Ctrl+C) even though it generated a transformation matrix
4. It could be worth to try using a full scale target and see if that improves anything
